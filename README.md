# Rainy Nights
> This is a short project I've been working on. It's an python discord bot and it does mostly everything.


I added it here for 2 reasons. One reason is because I host my bot on heroku so I don't have to manually host it myself.
2nd reason is because people can just use what I created. If you don't know what you are doing do not proceed.

## Help

When you're using my bot and it's all set up please do ?help for all of the commands.
You might have to change some things for example server id's, channel id's, and role names.
